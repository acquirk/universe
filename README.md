# Universal Markdown

This is intended to be a catalog of all major elements of the universe. *Major* is subjective, but generally I'm going for stuff larger than a football field.

I'm not really sure where to go with this. But I'm hoping to get input from some other folks to see if anyone thinks of anything cool to do with it.
